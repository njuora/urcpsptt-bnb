# urcpsptt-bnb

This is the results of the research article: An Exact Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for the Unit-Capacity Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Transfer Times (Ying Liu, Jing Zhou, Shuang Jin, Qian Hu)

1. urcpsptt_bnb-result.xlsx: results of BNB, CPLEX, and CP on uRCPSPTT benchmark instances

2. rcpsp_bnb_result.xlsx: results of BNB on RCPSP benchmark instances

 Note that tables used in the paper are presented in the first sheet in each MS excel document.

3. urcpsptt-sol.zip: detailed result of each instance of algorithms BNB, CPLEX, and CP. Note that activies have been renumbered according to the topological order.

4. rcpsp-sol.zip: detailed result of each instance of BNB algorithm. Note that activies have been renumbered according to the topological order.
